# Slides
This project is a library (and example app) made to simplify the process of creating educational Android apps. 
A list of lessons or tasks called "slides" can be compiled in a JSON file, and loaded into a set of activities for displaying their contents.
Slides can be simple, non-interactive content such as text or HTML, or they can be richer interactive content such as a text editor,
a spreadsheet, or other course-specific interfaces. While only a few slides are provided by default, new custom slides can be added and
utilized by the library.

"slides_lib" contains the core functionality of the project, and "slides" is an example app demonstrating how to use the library.
